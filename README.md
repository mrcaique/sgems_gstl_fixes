# SGeMS and GsTL fixes #

This repository contains the source files fixed for compiling [SGeMS](http://sgems.sourceforge.net/) in the recent versions of GCC.
To get the source code of SGeMS, the SVN repository can be seen [here](https://svn.code.sf.net/p/sgems/svn/trunk/) and the source code
of GsTL (it is a dependacy of SGeMS) can be seen [here](http://gstl.sourceforge.net/).

**NOTE**: Both SGeMS and GsTL are legacy projects!
